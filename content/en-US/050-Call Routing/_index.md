## Objective:

Now that our flow is created, we need to map it to a number. Toll-free numbers and DIDs can be purchased from the Genesys Cloud platform or ported from other carriers. When defining call routes, we can also create schedules and schedule groups. This allows for different actions and paths for an interaction to take based upon open and closed hours, on company holidays, or when an emergency route needs to be enabled.
