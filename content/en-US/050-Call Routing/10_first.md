## Create Call Route

On the Call Routing tab, you can view a list of active call flows and the telephone number or numbers tied to them. When a user dials a specific telephone number, or dialed address, they will be routed into the inbound call flow associated with that telephone number.

Return to the Admin Page of Genesys Cloud and search for Routing. In this category you’ll see our next two steps, **Call Routing** and **Scheduling.** Select **Call Routing**

Let’s map a phone number to our call flow created in Architect. Select the **Add Call Route** button at the top. 

We’ll name this route, “Workshop Route,” then select **Addresses +** at the top right to assign a number.

Begin typing out a number currently owned, and the UI will narrow the search of those available. Select the appropriate number, then click **Add.** Finally, **Save**
