## Test Flow

#### Debug

Defined earlier in our Architect Tools section, Debug allows us to test the flow before publishing it. Next to our Publish button, select the drop-down arrow and choose debug

Highlight and copy the code given,  click the phone icon on the left-side of you Genesys Cloud instance and start a new call. Paste the code where you would type the contact or number. Now dial out and listen to the flow, confirming the audio prompt provided and menu options are correct. 

If changes need to be made, return to the flow and continue the process of adjustments and debugging. Once completed, you may now publish the flow

#### Live Test

You will now test the live flow by calling into you IVR. It should sound and work similarly to your debug tests, only now routing to your agent after the Help Desk menu option is chosen.
