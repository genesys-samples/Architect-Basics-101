## Objective:

Now that our flow has been created and we've walked through the Starting Menu, we can begin to build out the IVR Flow. The Architect Toolbox provides a number of actions that vary depending on the Genesys Cloud license plan. 

In this module, we're familiarize you with some commonly used actions and construct a basic flow. You'll also understand how to recognize and correct errors, before moving on to testing.
