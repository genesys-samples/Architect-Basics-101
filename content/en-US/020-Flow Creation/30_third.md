## Languages & Speech Recognition

In our **Settings** Menu, we can set up both the **Supported Languages** for this flow, and **Speech Recognition Options**. Let’s start with **Support Languages**. 

Within a flow’s general configuration, you can configure supported languages. Architect lists the names of supported languages in audio-related forms, so that you can select a particular language for playback or recording of a prompt. 

Add the languages you want to support within the flow. When you select a supported language, Architect returns a message when it does not support runtime data playback or TTS playback for the selected language. Valid languages include IETF region subtags, for example: (en-US). Click the language you want to select as the default language for the flow.

For this tutorial, we won’t alter our speech recognition settings, nor change the default text-to-speech engine, but both properties are configurable here as well.
