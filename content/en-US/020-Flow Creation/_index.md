## Objective

In this module, you’ll learn how to get started creating a flow from scratch, along with naming conventions. We’ll take a look at the Starting Menu, and Settings that can be configured before building out your flow, such as languages and speech recognition. 

Genesys has a native text-to-speech engine, but also supports third-party TTS engine integrations. For more information around text-to-speech and supported languages in Genesys Cloud CX, please visit: https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-text-to-speech-tts-engines/
