## Add Flow

**Architect** can be found from the Admin page of Genesys Cloud. If you’re unable to access this, please confirm your roles and permissions with your Organization Admin. From the Architect Home Page, you’ll see a drop-down at the top, allowing you to select from the types of flows that Genesys Cloud CX supports natively. Initial Flows include Inbound Calls, Webchats, Email, Message (Web Message, SMS, Social), and Outbound Calls. Select **Inbound Call** then **+Add**.

When a flow is added, your first step is to name the flow. Naming conventions are important, especially when multiple Admins may be accessing the Architect tool. Give it a name that is relevant to the flow but is also quickly identifiable by other users. In a dev org environment, its best to have each user include their last name in a flow. For today’s tutorial, let’s name ours Workshop – “Your Last Name”. Click **Create Flow**.
