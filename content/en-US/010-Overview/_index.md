## Overview

Prerequisite: Genesys Cloud CX Channel Setup https://workshop.genesys.com/workshops/gride-demo/

Architect helps administrators and flow authors build call flows that answer a call automatically, present the caller with menu choices, and then route the call according to the caller’s choice. The options presented to your customers might change based on changes to your business. Whether it is a new order, a question, or an issue, routing through Architect allows callers to determine their needs by choosing among options.


To ensure that you route your customers in the most direct manner, periodically assess your call flow design. Architect is fully configured and operational–you do not need to download software or perform upgrades. Genesys Cloud stores the software and your data safely off site using the Internet.

Objective: In this course, you’ll walk through the process of building a basic IVR Inbound Call Flow. We’ll discuss naming conventions, set language options, and discuss speech recognition. You’ll leverage the flow toolbar to customize and configure the route path a call takes when entering the IVR. Learning to add audio prompts, use unique identifiers, and decide the route taken based on the contact center schedule. Lastly, we’ll test the route before running it to a “live agent.” This course will get you started in understanding the basics of Architect, before moving on to our level 200 course for more in-depth customization.
