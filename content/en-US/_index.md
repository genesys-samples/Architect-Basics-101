# Architect 101: Basics

## Welcome

This workshop is designed as an introductory course into the Genesys Cloud CX Architect Tool. 

Architect allows administrators and contact center managers to link together predefined operations to create simple or sophisticated menu applications. Use it to play audio, route interactions to agents, queues, voicemail, external numbers, or other flows. Incorporate advanced features such as non-menu digit collection, data dips, conditional logic, and expression editing. It is an easy-to-learn drag and drop web-based design tool that creates flows for media types. Architect uses menus and straight-to-queue logic most often associated with traditional auto-attendants. However, it also incorporates advanced, feature-rich logical operations such as non-menu digit collection, External Data Access (data dips), conditional logic, and expression editing to help develop the IVR functionality. Architect also provides centralized prompt management with multi-language support.

## Learning Objectives
- Create a Flow in Architect
- Create Tasks within a Flow
- Understand tools within Architect
