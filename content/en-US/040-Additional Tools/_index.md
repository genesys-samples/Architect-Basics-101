## Objective:

In this module we'll take a look at some tools available in Architect that enhance the user experience. Genesys's Architect Tool is designed for ease of use, allowing for MACD changes when necessary without the need of a coding or developer background. To counter the redundancy of re-creating flows, an interaction flow can be imported or exported to build off of what already exists. Tools also exist to test any IVR before deciding whether or not it is production-ready.
